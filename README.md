Through said application you can store recently bought food packages along with their expiration date. You can store products of your choice and associate them with different tags for categorisation. 

Through the “expiring” tab, you can see all packages that expire in the next 50 days, so you can plan ahead your food consumption and minimise waste.<img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2022-09-11 at 1 08 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89413115/190914273-ad7b750e-b7e8-4b92-90cc-5333bab4faec.png">
